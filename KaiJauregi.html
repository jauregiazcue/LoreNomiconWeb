              <p style="text-align: left;">On the level editor you are able to create and delete levels, apart from changing them. The good thing is that the file that is changed in the level editor is the same file the game uses for then loading the levels. In the level editor you are able to change all tiles into any tile type, having also extra information inside for the movable, pressure and lever tiles. You can also change the player's position, turns and other data, such as the enemies type, position,  if it will move when the game starts and escape root (I will talk about this later in the enemies point).

          <h2>Inventory & Objects</h2>

          <br>

          <h2>Interface</h2>

          <br>
          <h2>Player</h2>
          <p></p>

          <h2>Enemies</h2>
        
          <br>
          <h2>Grid & Tiles</h2>
          <p>The grid is generated using a json file that has all the information of the levels. It first creates all the different tiles of the level. After that it generates the player and all enemies, and with that it is capable to create all the interface (it is done this way to do the turns of these entities). Finally, it adds an extra wall on top of the wall types tiles, it rotates the doors and levers to make them be rotated correctly for the level taking in consideration the walls that surrounds those tiles, and it colour coded the doors with the levers and pressure plate that will change the doors states in the future.

          <br>
          <p ><span style="color:#b48b5f">Common Tile · </span>This one is the floor tile, it does not have any interactions with the entities.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Movable Tile · </span>The movable tile moves into an empty tile that is adjacent to the movable tile. What it actually does is change the empty tile to a movable tile, and the movable tile into an empty tile, changing the entities position into the new movable tile. </p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Open Door Tile · </span> The Open Door tile can be changed by other tiles into a closed door, apart from that it acts like a floor tile with a different obj and textures.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Preassure Tile · </span> Is the pressure plate tile, if an entity goes into this tile, it will update the tiles that this tile has inside (different kinds of doors or movable tiles).</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">End Level Tile · </span> The end level tile is a tile with an open door obj and texture, so that whenever the player enters on it the level will be finished and it will go to the Win State. The enemies are not able to walk into this tile due to them also being able to make the level be finished.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Wall Tile · </span> The Wall Tile is the first tile that the entities are not able to move into. For the checking of the entities if they are able to move into the tiles it checks if the enum is bigger than the wall tile (the order of the tiles here is the same as in the enum).</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Empty Tile · </span> It is the same thing as the Wall, with a different obj and textures, with the only difference that the meat is able to go through these tiles.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Closed Door Tile · </span> It is the same thing as the Wall, with a different obj and textures, apart from other tiles being able to turn it into an open door.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Wall With Lever Tile · </span> If the player interacts with it from an adjacent tile it will update the tiles inside the same way as the pressure tile.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Pillar Tile · </span> This is the empty pillar, it is just a wall with different obj and textures.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Pillar With Book / Flashlight / Meat Tile · </span> If this tile is interacted with the same way as a lever, the object will be added into the inventory and the pillar will become an empty pillar.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="color:#b48b5f">Pillar With Page Tile · </span> Same thing as the other pillar but instead of adding an object into the inventory it will add a page into the book.</p>
