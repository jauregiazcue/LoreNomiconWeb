          <br>
          <h2>Narrative</h2>

          <p>My main role as a designer was to be in charge of crafting the lore for each of the monsters as well as writing the dialogue that appears in-game. This required multiple different planning stages, such as researching into different already existing folklore to take inspiration from (wendigos inspiring the dires, for example), mind mapping to help plan out plot points and mechanics each creature would have, then drafting out the stories and receiving feedback from the team, making suitable changes where necessary. </p> 
            <br>
          <p>After this, I made the final documents that would be referenced throughout the development of the game, as it included things such as a quick one liner for their unique mechanic, a description of their appearance and, of course, the lore sections for the creatures. The dialogue followed a similar pipeline, first planning out what should be described through in-game dialogue, and then writing it all up into a document with descriptions of where each part should appear along with the final dialogue between the player and the book, as well as some that would be shown in the beginning to help set the scene for the player when they loaded in.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>UI Design</h2>
          <p>The next big part I played was actually tackling some of the art. Each bit of UI shown in game was made by going through multiple different iterations of their design. As a team we had settled on a hand drawn, Bendy and the Ink Machine esq art style, and so when creating these assets I tried to follow that aesthetic.</p>
          <br>
          <p>A good example of this is shown in the book pages the player collects throughout the game. The art I had created to put on the pages had to be clean enough to convey the ideas correctly, however it still had to remain sketchy to keep in with the theme of the game, and I think I pulled that off pretty well! Another good example of how I stuck to this kind of look is in the colour scheme itself. Once we had decided on the style we wanted I knew I would be fairly restricted on the colours I could use, and so the vast majority of the UI made stuck to the same sepia toned colours as these fit the game the best. Some elements, however, were done differently such as the bookmarks found on the pages. These were made different colours to help players distinguish which page was which much easier when flicking through them.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I also tried to use a range of different font styles that would fit the game best, opting to use small handwriting like fonts on the book pages to really help push the idea that this had been left behind by somebody who had written down everything long before you were trapped. For a lot of the UI that featured small amounts of text such as the turn indicators, the text-based buttons, and the UI that lets the player know what they should press next I used a completely different font as I didn’t want to detract from the experience of the game, so for these sections I had managed to find a font similar to one that was used within Bendy and the Ink Machine. Using this font allowed us to not only get closer to the overall aesthetic we wanted to achieve, but it also meant that in the sections where we would have to show text in between gameplay, it wouldn’t take away from the experience.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I also had to take the documents that I had created during my narrative work and make them into usable assets in the game as different parts of the UI. The lore document would become the pages the player would collect throughout the levels, telling them what to expect from the creature they would be encountering, and the dialogue would become a large number of text boxes that would appear, immersing the player even more as they conversed with the book they had to carry with them.</p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <h2>Extras</h2>
          <p>There were a couple extra parts I had worked on for the game, such as the game’s logo and the banner we would be using at the events we attended. They were good learning experiences for me, as I had to work to constraints I hadn’t had to before, such as getting the size for the logo correct so it would display properly on the home screen, and including everything that was needed within the banner dimensions. </p>
